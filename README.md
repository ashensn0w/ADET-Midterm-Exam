# Testing Branch

Branch off from the development branch, the testing branch functions as the testing environment. It is designated for testing new features to ensure their proper functionality before merging into the production branch. Serving as a quality control checkpoint, this branch helps identify and address any bugs or issues before they impact the final product.
